      "Content":"Toyota is transforming one of its former lands to a residential area where it will also test its cars. The land is a massive 175-acre sized one. The whole place is designed to be a futuristic place of living which is expected to house about 2000 people and it would be a smart city if you can term it as that. The Site is located at the base of Mount Fuji and will be designed by a Danish architect, Bjarke Ingels. The city will be powered by the company’s hydrogen fuel cell technology. Toyota has named this sit ‘The Woven City’. This is due to the fact that it will weave in together three different streets. One street will be meant for high speed moving vehicles, one for medium ranged speedy vehicle and normal bikes and scooters and a few pedestrians while the last one will be more of like a park that is meant for strictly pedestrians only. Every house will contain a house helping robot and a smart technology for monitoring the residents’ health. Normally car makers sue such huge pieces of land with the backdrop of a fake city to test out their cars but this project is different as it will contain real people, real families and all in all will be a real city with real parameters to keep in mind.

      "Content":"The world is full of so many architectural wonders. Kings and emperors of the long past put some astonishing designs and our new generation of architects are conquering the same field in their own innovative way. When we tour or even just browse through such wonders, we are faced with a great dilemma of picking old but fantabulous designs from new and refined creativity. Such a dilemma was a probable cause of a unique design that has caught the eye of many art admirers.Located about 70 miles Northwest of London in Northamotonshire this construction is a very sleek refinement of old design that has been blended in with the modern age. The location had signs of civilisation that abandoned it but it wasn’t residential. An architect from the nearby London city, Will Gamble Architects, had this amazing idea to convert and abandoned derelict factory into an eye-capturing residential place of stay which is worth an envy.  What is really remarkable about this is that such a glittering house was established and planned creatively within an already defined confinement and perimeter. The architect had this great challenge he had taken up all on his own on the opposition of the client that wanted the demolition of the whole existing structure. It is pretty much worth appreciating how the overall look was not touched at all and a glamourous residential place was set up in the conjugation of an old cow shed and an abandoned factory. A further motivation that create an extra driving force was that the factory was of much significance during its days and had its direct services to the Royal Family. As a finishing there is a beautiful clash of modern interior with the already existing ancient touch that makes this home stand out both its architectural amazement and interior satisfaction. The UK is still upholding most of its ancient designed buildings and castles and this step has been a contributing factor too.",

It specifically depicts the stating of The Lotus flower.
      Woods Bagot was carefully enough to conceive the idea of this building around the teachings of FO Guang Shan. It is entirely based on Buddhist philosophy and Humanitarian Buddhist teaching. This structure’s architecture is perfect for the supreme transition between the Temple and the institute.
      The architecture abstains any kind of hierarchy and has been kept very simple but with a modern touch. It is supposed to provide a neutral environment which is free from all kinds of materialism. The design is just the tip of the iceberg, the land on which the building lies was initially a garbage tip that was bought for one Australian Dollar by the Nan Tien Institute. `,

The original designing was done by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin in 1924. Due to its intense historical attachment it was very necessary to keep the theatre living, hence a restoration of the place was done. This project was taken u by Six Degrees Architects.
      The cinema needed a modern restoration to accommodate modern technology and give it an exciting feeling that will keep the audience in a fresh state of mind. The main element of restoration was its ceiling which has conjured a crystalline cave and now has an added feature of an LED lighting system which is synchronised with sound.
      While doing thee restoration it was important to pay key attention to the cinema’s rich heritage and that is why not much visible work was done. Most of the work was invested into upgrading the buildings standards to modern requirements and keep its integrity up.

The organisation has hired world renowned architects who have done marvellous work in designing their buildings. The most recent centre was opened in Sutton, England; designed by an architecture firm in London, Ab Rogers Design. Like its other centres, this one too has a glamourous visual appearance and great architectural input to it.
      The main aim of the building is to promote a friendly environment to the patients that has no essence of being a hospital. Judging from the design and what the outcome is the architect was successful in creating one that has a refreshing sensation and promote a home-like atmosphere with a very peaceful message. The exterior is dressed with red terracotta tiles that is nothing more than a psychological trailer for visitors to a very accommodating site in the interior.
      This station, named Maggie’s at the Royal Marsden is adjacent to the Royal Marsden Hospital and has a very complimenting view attached to it. There are four gardens around it which have also been designed by talented architects. The plants grow to a medium height which enable one to have a view of every part of the garden with just one deep gaze.
      The overall finish is pretty smooth with rounded edges in every room and the overall exterior façade that ensures a smooth transition between every gradient change. It has a supportive look promoted by the landscape around it and a garden house that is used for gatherings and chill outs.

Despite the relief of the place this house has been made to stand completely horizontally and is very firm with zero risks of falling apart, it is indeed very steady. Normally, the house has no such outstanding look that will highlight it on the map but when reasoned deeper it is an architectural conqueror too. Peter Zumthor has always been all about such challenges. He prefers to take up projects that are not so simple to execute. He likes to come up with designs that will push engineers beyond their limits to build the structure as designed with an assured integrity.

      "Content":`The best feeling of being in a house is when it has the same feeling as being outside but with more security. Steam architects and associates have accomplished such a goal in a very tight-fitting space where such a design would be automatically outstanding. The house has a floor-to-ceiling opening on most if its walls and an additional skylight that shines through the house. It is a beautiful intersection of two cube-like structures of the house in a synchronous harmony. Apart from the upper level of the house, there are no walls in the interior of the house. Every section of every floor is blended with such peace into each other that the flow is seems like an eternal one. The structure has outdone the limitations of the precise location of the site and hence is a stand-out against its neighbouring houses. The perfect feeling of freedom is induced by that tie of naturally lit and undivided floors. Every detail of this house has been designed to give an appealing sight be it during the day or at night. `,

It really isn’t mandatory that such marvellous designs should be expensive. The Yelm residence in the United States is a classic example. The designers, Coates Design and Seattle Architects, carefully came up with one that uses cost-effective materials and inclusively respects its native environment. This country home has modern and cheap written all over it. Every inch of the house has been designed with sheer simplicity and echoes respect for it surrounding. The materials used are indigenous and quite cheap too hence reducing the overall worth of the home. The design is pretty informal ad suite the client’s profession and hobbies just right. The L-shaped plan allows for perfect isolation of the workstation and garage from the social centres of the house. The glass panes that surround the interior offer a good connection to the landscape in view both physically and psychologically. The plan is designed with such precision and meant be warm in heat or cold and has natural ventilation for an everlasting freshness.   `,

This is a very prominent cultural and commercial destination and attracts thousands daily. The design is a perfect trend to lend in with its surrounding but it still manages to capture the attention relatively. The whole façade has highly transparent properties due to its floors being completely glass and that’s what also gives it the glossy look without the application of extra efforts. The building owes its glamour to the felling of openness it offers with entry into it.  In addition to that its exterior extensions and glass shades give a sense of privacy to the building’s users with a calm sensation. The floating canopy had a lively setting and a tranquil atmosphere as it illuminates the rear streetscape.  The development aims to drive Shanghai forwards as an open, modern, multifunctional and world-class city. `,

      "Content":`Every city in the world faces a problem of congestion and offering an affordable living space especially to students. This is really a situation of alarm as it causes a lot of disturbances in the city and settlement problems. As a solution, URBAN RIGGER® in conjunction with Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) made use of an underused harbour in Central Copenhagen to plan a floating housing structure for students. The creative idea involves making use of shipping containers in beautiful harmony to bring up a structure that gives an adorable view from sea and land and has every housing component to offer the students living there all the comfort that they want. It also has an indoor and outdoor communal area where the students can meet and relax. The furnishings are made from recycled materials and the heat source is the adjacent sea water. Such characteristics make it self-sustaining hence making it affordable. The place upholds relevant prestige and an additional honour to a residential solution and sustainable living.  `,

      "Content":`Le Corbusier famously said that ‘a house is a machine for living in.’ This is what inspired sky-frame to come with a new design for their revolving door. The doors are pivoted to the wall that they have a synchronous connection with the building. They act as a smooth and fluid transition between two rooms or even between the interior and the exterior of the house. They are very simple creations but meant to look very stylish. When opened, they give a feeling of no difference between the two transiting gradients and free flow is maintained both physically and psychologically. The doors are very smooth on their movement and have a very strong and durable to hold the glass pane in place. They can be customised as entry and exit doors, as room divisions or an interior-exterior passage. With just a small effortless touch the doors slide open and offer the pleasure of a grand entrance. It is the best solution for a modern and minimal door solution. The openings are quite large to allow free flow of air and frames pretty slim to allow an uninterrupted view of the landscape ahead. `,

This is probably the most identifiable feature of the building amongst other eye blazing structures. The interior has its amazements with a very welcoming view. The building provides 210 lecture halls, various seminar halls, a common lounge and forum space, offices and food service space.  It also has a kind of a social hub with a large sitting area and three-storey fireplace.  The library has been made to imitate the conditions of modern workplaces whereby the pavilion is naturally lit on three sides and a two-storey reading hall where discussions and notions can also be carried out. As an acknowledgement of the marvellous work done by B+H Architects and Hariri Pontarini Architects in designing the place, this building won the Canadian Architect Award of Excellence in 2013 when still a design. `,

It sits there proudly overlooking the sea and with a great view of the evening sunset over the neighbouring island of Delos. It is a six-bedroom home that has a camouflaging look in the hills due to its stone-walled garden. It has the entire idea of a summer-oriented mind to allow for a peaceful and harmonious living of the family. Every space in the house is the perfect excuse for rest and exploration. It has the perfect protection from climate’s elements to keep the guests entertained and relaxed. The house has a beautiful courtyard that avoids all complex constructions and still preserves the traditional look of the island. It has a clean division of social and private space. Even with such privacy maintained the viewers are not snatched off of their right to an amazing view at whatever time of the day. Above the bedrooms sits a swimming pool which will undoubtedly cool off anyone who dives in and keep the rooms underneath cool too. The materials used for construction and furnishing give the perfect feeling of a contemporary locality and modern tradition of the place with very feeling and sight of the place preserved. It is quite commendable that its view is very natural and the interiors have been lit naturally with wide openings to allow in natural sunlight and fresh air to keep you remotely refreshed. The house has a very simple finish on the outside but has the classic comfort and luxury ion the inside. The walls enclose a paradise of unexperienced and unexplored bliss in the other side.`,

Filter Architecture had this brand out-of-the-box idea to construct a structure in a place that is all about nature but had its own requirement of a shelter for a rest. It is situated in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is rested on the mountain of Visocica, a mountain range that is 1974m above sea level. It is geographically a marvellous view that has its basic composition of common sedimentary rocks. It offers the perfect service of shelter to hikers who go that way and it has an untold harmony with the surrounding with a quite blend around. It is set between two mountains called Visocica and Bjelasnica. The landscape of the particular place offers an ideal stage for the cabin as it connects the two mountains and it is a very common route for hikers. The interior of the cabin has three platforms that acts as the bed, bench and floor areas. It can accommodate up to nine people who can sit on the benches facing each other. As filter architecture put it, “the bivouac was built with very limited resources, under difficult high mountain conditions, but with enormous voluntary engagement and cooperation that would be impossible in a purely commercial context.” The project had its ups and downs and mainly filled with challenges but at long last the result was a beauty to keep looking back at. `,

      "Content":`Spiritual places are meant to be full of never-ending peace and a bright environment to keep the minds concentrated to the very environment it is in. In south America is The Bahá’í Temple that follows such a principle. It uses light as its principle inspiration. It is a representation of the last eight temples commissioned by the Bahá’í community. It has a soothing covering of glass veils, nine in number, encloses an enormous worship space that can house up to 600 visitors. The whole place has been lit naturally with sunlight coming in from the glass veils illuminating an interior of translucent Portuguese marble. At sunset, the light captured within the dome shifts from white to silver to ochre and purple. A lot of paradoxical thoughts and large creative mindset to give this project the face and trait it has today. The parts of the skeletal structure were made in Germany in manageable parts and later in shipped to Chile for assembly into the massive structure and continues to amaze the world. The interior is filled hand-finished materials to give a very unique, fine and warm feeling inside the temple. The temple’s structure and construction are a very well elaborate one for the purpose that it widely serves the community with. The completed Temple has been described as “one of architecture’s most ambitious undertakings” by the Globe and Mail.`,
